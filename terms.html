The Commission shall be deemed to be exclusive of value added tax or any other applicable tax.</p>

      <p>6.2 The fee is calculated at the end of each month and payments must be made monthly for late payments no later than the 25th day of the following calendar month, provided that the amount due exceeds EUR 300 for bank transfer withdrawals and EUR 100 for all other withdrawal methods (“ Minimum Threshold") and the amount is not subject to further approval. If the balance due is less than the Minimum Threshold, it is accumulated and rolled over to the following month and becomes payable when the total amount of the Commission in the aggregate exceeds the Minimum Threshold. The payment period may be extended if fraudulent activity is detected. In this situation, Casbit Group N.V. reserves the right to conduct a detailed investigation.</p>

      <p>6.2.1. If the Affiliate claims the Commission after the 6 (six) months from the date of occurrence of this Commission, Casbit Group N.V. reserves the right to pay this Commission within 6 (six) month after the receiving of the Affiliate's claim (the whole amount or in parts at the discretion of Casbit Group N.V.).</p>

Examples of alternative commission structures could include a Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) model, Hybrid, etc. However, and for the avoidance of doubt, only one type of Commission Structure for the same product may be applied at the same time. Therefore, once an Affiliate accepts Casbit Group N.V.’s offer to apply a new commission structure, different to the standard Commission Structure detailed in the Affiliate Agreement, the Affiliate hereby agrees and understands that the new proposed commission structure shall replace his existing commission structure in its entirety. Notwithstanding the above, the Affiliate’s obligations assumed under the Affiliate Agreement will still continue to apply to the Affiliate even if a new commission structure is applicable.</p>

      <p>You shall be entitled to a one-off commission based on a number of new depositing players directed to our brands who have successfully met minimum deposit, wagering and/or other requirements as per prior agreement. These amounts are at the discretion of Casbit Group N.V. and we reserve the right to change these amounts with prior written notice at any time. All CPA deals are subject to a 24-Hour termination policy. Casbit Group N.V. decision with regards to this will be considered final and no further correspondence will be entered into. Right of admission to the CPA Program will be reserved at all times and for any reason. If we determine, in our sole discretion, that you are enrolled in the CPA Program to benefit from it by referring players that we deem not legitimately interested in our products or services or of a similar average value to our current players, we reserve the right to terminate your participation in the Program with immediate effect. Should this occur, from the moment of your notification, your CPA payment generated on existing or new referred players will be forfeited and considered null and void with no further correspondence entered into.</p>

      <p>6.8 If you select a Hybrid Payment Casbit Group N.V. shall pay you:</p>

      <p>The selected hybrid CPA payments payable in accordance with the preliminary agreed terms;</p>
      <p>The selected “Revenue Share” percentages of Net Casino for as long as each Customer has an account with Casbit Group N.V. brands.</p>
      <p>6.9 The Affiliate’s acceptance of the payment of the Commission shall be deemed to constitute the full and final settlement of the balance due for the relevant period.</p>

      <p>6.10 If either Party disagrees with the balance due, it shall notify the other Party within fifteen (15) days and state the reasons of the disagreement. The disputed amount shall then be compared by Casbit Group N.V. to reports offered in the Casbit Group N.V. Affiliate Account system and the Casbit Group N.V. database, and the final amount payable shall be as per the figure reported on the database.</p>

      <p>6.11 The Affiliate shall have the sole responsibility to pay any and all taxes, levies, fees, charges and any other money payable or due both locally and abroad (if any) to any tax authority, department or other competent entity as a result of the compensation generated under the Affiliate Agreement.

      <p>6.12.2.2 The negative balance carried forward that was generated by the High roller(s) cannot be set-off against other Customers’ future positive Net Revenue;</p>
